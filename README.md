# Script Dump
This is a repository where I dump some handy shell scripts I've made over the years on Linux for various purposes.

These have been created for personal reasons and thus cannot be expected to be properly maintained and I'm only dumping them here to store as a backup, but if anyone actually ends up using them and encounters issues feel free to post an issue or pull request, and I may just update.
